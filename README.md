# Holy-Verse-Generator
Holy Verse Generator: Talk With Allah
Our project is inspired from Terry A. Davis'
talk with god program, the difference is:
in Davis' program, the algorith generates a word.
In our program the algorithm will generate a full
sentence. The words that will be used in program
will be the words in Quran, therefore Allah's.
Task List:
-The words should be organized as: subject, verb,
object, adjective and so on.
-The algorithm will randomly choose a word from every
section and create a sentence.
